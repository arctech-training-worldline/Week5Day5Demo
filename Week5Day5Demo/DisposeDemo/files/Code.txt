Wishing for a holiday
Alone at home, staring at a screen,
My class is on, for me to learn.
My friends I see, only online,
when before I could meet them, at every turn.

Alone at home, watching the sunrise,
The chirping of birds, singing of the rolling tide.
Thinking of people, watching the sunset,
Why can’t I visit that land? I cried.

Alone at home, staring at a screen,
Watching moving pictures of a distant land.
I strain my ears listening to my father talk,
wishing I was on a beach holding his hand.

Alone at home, dreaming of times,
when my parents would say.
Daughter my dear, are you ready,
to go on a jet plane for an exciting holiday.

Alone at home, staring at a screen,
watching people from cities far away.
Writing down in my diary,
So I can go say hello to them, some day

Alone at home, listening to my parents
talking of holidays we have been.
Remembering the good old times,
with a big naughty grin.

Alone at home, staring at a screen,
I dream of snow-clad mountains and stormy rivers.
Wearing warm clothing sometimes,
and other times, dress up like swimmers.

The time will come, when we,
Don’t have to be alone at home anymore.
We could go anywhere,
And walk among the waves on the seashore.
 
The time will come, when we
Can return to school.
Meet our friends and
Play the fool.

The time will come, when we
Will wait for school to end.
So holidays can begin,
And we could travel, and make a new friend.

So take my message everyone, and
plan your holidays with a joyful cry.
The times will surely change,
And we will again spread our wings and fly.
